## Notes

The most notable challenge I faced while designing the tip calculator was implementing the settings page. I have created it and although it is non-functional at the moment, I do intend to fix it.

Another challenge was that of UI design. I took some inspiration from the provided examples and went with the theme of dark and light shades of a color, starting off with pink. It looked extremely tacky and so I switched to blue.
